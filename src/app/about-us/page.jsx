                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p>AltiEdge is more than a training platform — it’s a movement to prepare climbers to meet the mountains on their terms. Founded by seasoned Indian mountaineers, we provide personalized, science-driven mentorship that blends endurance, strength, mental conditioning, nutrition, acclimatization, and technical skills into one cohesive program.</p>
                <p>By tracking progress and analyzing biometric data, we build efficient, resilient climbers who are fully prepared for high-altitude challenges and committed to safe, responsible mountaineering.</p>
                <h2>Why Train?</h2>
                <p>
                  The world&apos;s most stunning peaks are also the most unforgiving. Thin air, low oxygen, and relentless exertion demand more than conventional fitness — they require targeted preparation rooted in physiology and precision.
                  AltiEdge ensures every climber can adapt, perform, and return safely, no matter how extreme the climb.
                </p>
                <h2>Why Climb?</h2>
                <p>
                  Climbing is more than reaching summits — it&apos;s about overcoming fear, pushing limits, and finding clarity in wild, unyielding places. Each ascent transforms you, forging resilience, camaraderie, and a profound connection with nature&apos;s raw beauty.
